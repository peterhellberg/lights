A command line tool for circadian lighting at my desk.

> Note: This code is meant for my own use, written as a lab day project, do not expect much.

## Usage

```
lights      # Toggles both of the lights ON or OFF
lights -i   # Show information about the current state
```

```go
$ lights --help
Usage of lights:
  -af string
    	the address of the Fill Light's HTTP API (default "http://filllight:9123")
  -ak string
    	the address of the Key Light's HTTP API (default "http://keylight:9123")
  -bf value
    	set Fill Light brightness to an absolute (between 0 and 100) or relative (-N or +N) percentage
  -bk value
    	set Key Light brightness to an absolute (between 0 and 100) or relative (-N or +N) percentage
  -c	calculate and set the appropriate circadian lighting values
  -i	display the current status of the lights without changing their state
  -tf value
    	set Fill Light temperature to an absolute (between 2900 and 7000) or relative (-N or +N) degrees
  -tk value
    	set Key Light temperature to an absolute (between 2900 and 7000) or relative (-N or +N) degrees
```

> I have also bound `Ctrl+F11` to toggle the Key Light, and `Ctrl+F12` to toggle the Fill Light.
